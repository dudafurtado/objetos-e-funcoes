# Object

## when the terminal of javascript print [object] other than teh value, what does that mean?

1. In JavaScript, when you try to print an object using console.log(), you may sometimes see [object Object] instead of the actual value of the object. This happens when you try to print an object directly without specifying a property or method to display.

[object Object] is simply a default string representation of the object that is printed by the console. It indicates that the variable being printed is an object and the object's type is Object.

To see the actual value of the object, you can try printing a specific property or method of the object instead of the object itself. For example, if you have an object named person with a name property, you can print the name using console.log(person.name).

If you want to see more information about the object, you can use console.dir() instead of console.log(). console.dir() displays the properties and methods of an object in a tree-like format, which can be useful for debugging and exploring the contents of an object.

2. When the JavaScript terminal prints "[object]", it usually means that the value being printed is an object, but the terminal is unable to display its contents.

In JavaScript, objects can have various properties and methods that define their behavior. When you print an object to the terminal, it will try to display its properties and their values. However, if the object is too complex or doesn't have a useful string representation, the terminal will simply display "[object]" to indicate that the value is an object.

To get a better understanding of what the object contains, you can try using console.log() to print the object to the console instead of the terminal. This will allow you to inspect the object in more detail, including its properties and methods.
